    <p>
      Batch normalization (also known as batch norm) is a method used to make artificial i
      neural networks faster and more stable through normalization of the layers' inputs 
      by re-centering and re-scaling. It was proposed by Sergey Ioffe and Christian 
      Szegedy in 2015.[1]

      While the effect of batch normalization is evident, the reasons behind its 
      effectiveness remain under discussion. It was believed that it can mitigate the 
      problem of internal covariate shift, where parameter initialization and changes 
      in the distribution of the inputs of each layer affect the learning rate of the 
      network.[1] Recently, some scholars have argued that batch normalization does not 
      reduce internal covariate shift, but rather smooths the objective function, 
      which in turn improves the performance.[2] However, at initialization, batch 
      normalization in fact induces severe gradient explosion in deep networks, which 
      is only alleviated by skip connections in residual networks.[3] Others sustain 
      that batch normalization achieves length-direction decoupling, and thereby 
      accelerates neural networks.[4] More recently a normalize gradient clipping 
      technique and smart hyperparameter tuning has been introduced in Normalizer-Free 
      Nets,so called "NF-Nets" which mitigates the need for batch normalization.[5][6]
